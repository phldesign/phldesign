*_EDIT: We’re getting a lot of applications from Web Developers. This job is for design only, no code involved. We’re looking for someone to deliver high-quality mockups using Sketch. That’s the job._

_If you badly wish to show off how awesome of a developer you are, send us a link to your github and we’ll keep you in mind for when we’re looking to add a dev. Now back to your regularly scheduled programming._

Oh and another thing: please, please provide a link to your portfolio. No portfolio link means your application is immediately thrown into the ocean and used as chum for sharks.

We’re Copter Labs, and we’re looking for someone to help us design awesome websites.

We’re a small fun-loving design firm that’s growing faster than … a thing that grows really fast?

We specialize in small business websites, particularly for personal trainers, nutritionists, and gyms. We build beautiful websites that help clients grow their brand while also making them tons of sweet, sweet cash.

We have a very good reputation in the fitness industry, and fortunately this means we have a lot of work. Basically, we need YOUR help.

### These are the key things we look for in a Copter team member:

* You are self-driven with the ability to manage multiple projects.
* You are able to give and receive constructive criticism as part of the team dynamic.
* You are excited to learn how we do things, and are ready to bring new things to teach us.
* You pay attention to detail.
* You can design using a grid system.
* You make deadlines.
* You don’t take yourself so darn seriously.

### Stuff we use:

* Bootstrap
* Wordpress
* Bohemian Coding’s Sketch app
* Slack
* Basecamp

Right now we’re looking for freelancers to help us out, and if things go well on the first few dates we’re totally open to going steady.

If you’re interested, please email us at info@copterlabs.com with your portfolio, resume (if you’re in to that sort of thing), and hey, maybe even a reference or two.

Now let’s all hold hands and make websites and stuff. ¯_(ツ)_/¯
