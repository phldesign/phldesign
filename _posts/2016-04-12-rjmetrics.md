As a member of the Engineering Team at RJMetrics, you can expect to:

Work alongside some of the best engineers, designers, and marketers in the business on a diverse and exciting set of projects that will help us to better demonstrate the strengths of each of our products. This includes but isn’t limited to iterating on and executing a redesign of RJMetrics’ public web presence. Other examples include new marketing site and landing pages, email templates and other marketing and growth projects.

Help us to advance the user experience inside of our products, alongside our product and design teams.

* Have worked with Wordpress and built or modified custom themes
* Understand the DOM, and how to manipulate it with javascript
* Have an eye for design, and are opinionated about how a UI looks and feels
* Be fearless. We are looking for someone who isn’t afraid of getting their hands dirty in the terminal with some backend coding and hacking on and deploying with our awesome grunt-based static site generator
