Think Brownstone has been named one of the Best Places to Work by the Philadelphia Business Journal! 

We’re looking for skilled UI and UX designers well-versed in the fundamentals of digital experience design. To us, this is someone who approaches and works through difficult problems systematically; transforms high-level ideas into a concrete UI with a polished, beautiful aesthetic; and prizes clarity of communication over conceptual or visual flourish. UI and UX designers play an essential role on our teams. During a project, they normally collaborate closely with stakeholders, researchers, and developers. Given this level of involvement, we expect designers to be comfortable discussing their craft fluently without relying on jargon. You can read more about how we work and what we value here: http://www.thinkbrownstone.com/about/.

In this contractor role, you’ll join a Think Brownstone team working largely on-site with one of our Center City-based clients. During this 3–6 month engagement you’ll work on a core business application addressing issues throughout a series of Agile sprints, partnering with existing teams and in direct communication with client stakeholders. Your in-person presence as a consultant will be critical to see this project through.

### The essentials:

* A deep passion and ability to create beautiful digital interfaces from scratch
* Evidence that you can build and apply a coherent interaction design language
* Pride in communicating your design ideas and process clearly
* Ability to capture, generate, and document detailed design requirements
* Experience working in an Agile environment
* Willingness to work on-site in Center City

If this sounds compelling, submit your application and include a cover letter explaining why you feel you’re right for Think Brownstone and samples of your best design work—preferably in an online portfolio. We look forward to hearing from you!
