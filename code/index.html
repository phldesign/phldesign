		<p>We value the participation of each member of the community and want everyone to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all members are expected to show respect and courtesy to other members.</p>
		<p>To make clear what is expected, all members, organizers and volunteers associated with the PHLDesign community are required to conform to the following Code of Conduct.</p>
		<h3>Member Code of Conduct</h3>
		<p>The PHLDesign community is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone. Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.</p>
		<p><strong>Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other members. Behave professionally. Be careful in the words that you choose.</strong> Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for the PHLDesign community.</p>
		<p>If a member engages in behavior that violates this code of conduct, the organizers will take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender, expulsion from the group or group sponsored events, or removing access to the PHLDesign Slack community.</p>
		<p>If you at any time feel harassed or treated inappropriately please contact <a href="mailto:hello@phldesign.org">hello@phldesign.org</a>.</p>
